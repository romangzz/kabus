# 🚀 Kabus

## Overview

Kabus is a **lightweight, framework-agnostic library** for implementing **Command, Query, and Event buses**, following the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern**. It offers an **in-memory implementation** while being **extensible** to support external messaging systems like RabbitMQ, Kafka, and others.

## ✨ Features
